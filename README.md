# üîê AI-Augmented Educational Platform Security and Enhancement Strategy

## Overview

This document proposes a comprehensive strategy to enhance and future-proof educational platforms (e.g., Acellus) in the face of rapid AI development, student circumvention techniques, and cybersecurity threats. It offers pragmatic, cost-effective, and scalable solutions based on client-side LLM inference, ethical AI tutoring, content protection, and anti-tamper systems.

---

## üöÄ Motivation

While systems like **Acellus** provide a valuable educational structure, they are increasingly vulnerable to AI-assisted circumvention. Legacy methods like image-based question delivery and copy-paste prevention are now ineffective against modern tools such as **Microsoft Copilot** or **ChatGPT**, which can extract, analyze, and solve problems directly from screenshots or browser views.

The educational environment must shift from reactive to **adaptive**‚Äîleveraging AI not just to defend, but to **enhance** learning while maintaining integrity and ethics.

---

## üîß Problems Identified

1. **Image-based question delivery is obsolete**  
   Screenshots processed by AI defeat this method. This was meant to prevent question scraping, but OCR and vision-based LLMs easily bypass it.

2. **Lack of text-based question backing**  
   Without a standardized textual database, integrating AI tutoring and consistency checks becomes infeasible.

3. **Centralized LLMs are cost-prohibitive**  
   Hosting LLMs server-side for every user query is unsustainable at scale.

4. **Student tampering via DevTools**  
   Anti-debugging can be bypassed using browser extensions (e.g., [Anti Anti Debug](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/anti-anti-debug/mnmnmcmdkigakhlfkcdimghndnmomfeo)).

5. **Potential for inappropriate AI responses**  
   Left unchecked, LLMs may generate unsafe or inappropriate outputs.

6. **Tampering and reverse engineering**  
   Client-side code can be altered to automate cheating unless integrity verification is enforced.

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### ‚úÖ Use `webLLM` for Client-Side Inference

Deploy small-to-medium open-weight language models such as [**Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct**](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) **directly in the user's browser** via `webLLM`. This:

- Eliminates server cost
- Enables offline usage
- Prevents server-side overload
- Enhances user responsiveness

### üß© Prompt Structure & Educational Strategy

Two modes should exist:

#### 1. **Static Analytical Prompt**
```plaintext
"Take the question: [X], which is related to the topic [Y], and generate a similar but distinct question. Then, walk the user through a full conceptual breakdown of how to solve it."
````

#### 2. **Chat Agent Prompt**

```plaintext
"You are an AI assistant helping a student understand the topic of [Subject]. Never reuse the original question. Instead, walk the user through related problems using novel examples and promote independent reasoning."
```

> All AI outputs **must avoid** repeating original content, focusing on guided understanding and concept-building.

---

## üîí AI Output Filtering (Safety Layer)

To prevent harmful outputs:

1. **Hard Filter Bad Words (Pre-Inference)**
   Use [this list](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words) to blacklist unsafe terms before any prompt hits the model.

2. **Post-Inference Safety Check**
   Run all AI responses through a second, smaller **zero-memory model** (e.g., distilled Phi variant).
   It returns:

   * `"YES"` if content is safe
   * `"NO"` if it contains violations

This two-layer filter ensures responses remain ethical and compliant, while incurring **no server cost** due to WebGPU acceleration in-browser.

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Debug and DevTools Detection

### Threat:

Chrome extensions and power users can disable anti-debug hooks, exposing your logic.

### Solution: Watch for Window Resize Events (A Known Indicator of DevTools)

```html
<script>
  const initialWidth = window.innerWidth;
  const initialHeight = window.innerHeight;

  window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
    const widthChanged = window.innerWidth !== initialWidth;
    const heightChanged = window.innerHeight !== initialHeight;

    if (widthChanged || heightChanged) {
      window.close(); // May fail if not opened by script
      document.body.innerHTML = `
        <h1>Access Denied</h1>
        <p>Window resizing is not allowed.</p>`;
      document.body.style.cssText = `
        background: black;
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
        margin-top: 20%;
      `;
    }
  });
</script>
```

> You may supplement this with frame busting and screen dimension checks for stricter enforcement.

## üîê Anti-Tamper Heartbeat System

### Problem:

Client code may be altered to automate responses or bypass checks.

### Solution: **Encrypted Client-Server Heartbeat System**

#### Mechanism:

* On load, server generates:

  * A **time-sensitive token**
  * A **random salt**
* Client-side JS generates:

  * A **checksum** from page state + time + salt
  * Sends this to the server at regular intervals

#### Server:

* Validates checksum
* If missing or mismatched:

  * Terminates session
  * Logs out user
  * Flags potential tampering

#### Benefits:

* Prevents emulation
* Obfuscates validation logic
* Functions like **military-grade integrity verification**
* Allows rollback or log replay to detect anomalies

* Encourage **guided, ethical AI-assisted learning**
* Protect content and user experience
* Respect user privacy and decentralization
